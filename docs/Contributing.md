## Reporting Issues

---

Have you found a problem in Chord Fiddle and are able to reproduce it? Do you an idea for a new feature you would like to see implemented?

We are a small team (well, really, it's just me) so let's make this as easy as possible.

### Look for Existing issues first

Before creating an issue, please search [open issues](https://github.com/felipemullen/chord-fiddle-issues/issues) for a similar request that has already been filed.

If your issue is similar to an existing issue, please add a comment or reaction to the original issue. Avoid comments such as "I agree" or "+1" and use a reaction instead:

- üëç (upvote)
- üëé (downvote)

If you have searched but cannot find any similar existing issues that describes your request, please use the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Issues should not contain multiple features or bugs. One issue should be created for each problem you find, or feature you would like to request.

The more information you can provide, the easier it will be to reproduce and fix the issue.

Please include the following with each issue:

- Steps to reproduce the issue (1... 2... 3...)
- What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
- Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring
